    <p>In 2018, AT&T only bought the company formerly known as Time Warner and renamed the unit WarnerMedia. WarnerMedia owns Warner Bros and Turner (which Time Warner acquired in 1995). WarnerMedia was officially spun off from AT&T in 2022 and combined with Discovery Inc to become Warner Bros Discovery in the spring of 2022</p>
